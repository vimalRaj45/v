      <p>Welcome to the Sona College of Technology Event Management Portal! This platform is designed to be your central hub for accessing, exploring, and registering for a variety of events hosted by Sona College. From technical hackathons to cultural festivals, we bring you an array of opportunities to learn, showcase talents, and build lifelong memories. Whether you’re here to participate, organize, or simply discover the diverse events Sona College offers, this platform provides a streamlined and engaging experience for everyone.

        What We Offer
        Our event management portal is carefully crafted to cater to all interests and academic pursuits. We understand that students have varied interests, so our events cover a wide range of domains:
        
        Technical Events: These include Innovation Sprout, IOT InnovateXpo, Quiz to Quirk, ML AL Fusion, and many more. Technical events are designed to inspire innovation and provide hands-on learning experiences, connecting theoretical knowledge to practical applications.
        
        Non-Technical Events: Non-technical events like Memo O Mania, Karaoke, and Image Finder allow students to enjoy, relax, and showcase their creative skills outside of the academic environment.
        
        Each event listing provides details like the date, time, location, and event theme. Whether you’re looking to participate in a hackathon, attend a cultural night, or enjoy a technical exhibition, our platform has something for everyone.
        
        Easy Registration Process
        We have simplified the registration process to save you time. Each event has a specific form accessible directly from this portal. With options to enter basic details such as name, registration number, department, and event-specific questions, our forms are quick and easy to complete. We ensure that your information is securely handled and registration confirmations are instantly provided through interactive pop-ups, so you’re notified right away.
        
        Department Events
        The Department Events section categorizes events by department (e.g., CSE, ECE, Mechanical, Civil), allowing you to explore events specific to your field. This is particularly useful if you’re interested in networking within your department or finding events that align closely with your studies and career aspirations. Each department regularly updates its events, bringing you fresh and relevant experiences.
